BAIS 3300 Homework 7

The purpose of this assignment was to create a web form based aroud student lifestyles. I was able to further my HTML5 CSS Git and Github skills with this assingment. 

One way that my web form conforms to best practices is having a user friendly design. Required questions are flagged with an "*" to let the user know what is required and what is not. On top of this help icons and questions descriptions can increase the user experience on my form. 

On top of this, the use of help icons and "*" denoting required fields helps keep it simple for the user to easily navigate the form and understand what is needed from them. 

Another best practice I used on my form is easy navigation from page to page where it prompts you with questions regarding student lifestyles or a thank you message prompted by completing the form.
